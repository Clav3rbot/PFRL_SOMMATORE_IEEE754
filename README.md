## Description

This project involves creating a floating-point adder that adheres to the IEEE754 standard. The adder can handle both normalized and denormalized operands, as well as special cases such as NaN (Not a Number) and Infinity.
It is implemented using a pipelined architecture.
The component has been tested using appropriate test benches to ensure its correct operation in various scenarios.

Repository of the project developed for the "Final project in Digital Logic Design" course, part of the Bachelor of Science in Engineering of Computing System at Politecnico di Milano.
